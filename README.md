👋 I’m @PLGraham, an architect, postdoctoral reearcher, university teacher and director of studies 
👀 I’m interested in the interfaces between housing markets, housing architecture and housing tenure
🌱 I’ve recently published a journal paper describing the conceptual framework for a metagame method for testing the adjustability of housing
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with designers to develop this project into a 2D physical, tile-based game (think Carcassone) or a 3D digital game
